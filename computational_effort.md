# Computational effort

The total runtime for the reproducibility package was approximately 3 hours on a late 2017 MacBook Pro laptop. The Docker
environment introduces latency with I/O. We recommend installing pyCSEP in a `conda` environment and running in the native OS
for optimal performance. Installation instructions can be found on the pyCSEP [documentation](https://docs.cseptesting.org/).

Laptop Specs:
    Processor: 2.9 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
    Ram: 16 GB 2133-MHz LPDDR3
    HD: 1Tb SSD SATA
