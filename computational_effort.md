# Computational effort

The total runtime for the reproducibility package was approximately 3 hours on a late 2017 MacBook Pro laptop. The Docker
environment introduces latency with I/O. We recommend installing pyCSEP in a `conda` environment and running in the native OS
for optimal performance. Installation instructions can be found on the pyCSEP [documentation](https://docs.cseptesting.org/)
